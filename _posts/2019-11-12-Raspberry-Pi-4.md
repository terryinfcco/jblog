Ever since I got the Raspberry Pi 4 (so for several months now) I’ve had switching set up so that I could use both my tower computer and the Pi 4 with the same keyboard, mouse, monitors, and sound equipment. And every week or so I’d get the idea that I was going to use the Pi 4 as my main computer. And I’d get frustrated with Aw Snap and Video Renderer errors on YouTube and Udemy. Plus there isn’t a Dropbox client for Linux ARM. And I’d switch back to using the tower full time. Well, I’ve finally had it and I pulled all the cables and switches and the Pi 4 being used from the main work area is no more. Right now I’m planning to connect the Pi 4 to the computer in front of the treadmill and using some kind of remote to be able to watch Udemy courses from the treadmill. But that’s for a future blog post.
