I’m going to try to keep this up to date. Not sure exactly what that means. I’m currently working on my Freecell that I’ve written in Python. I’m pretty out of touch with it, so I think the first thing might just be to go through it and document it in either a flowchart or pseudo code. I’m currently using Kubuntu 20.04 on the Beelink U55, but I’m never satisfied with anything. My current problem with i3 is the way it handles the developer console in Chrome / Chromium. And I’ve tried the new version of Ubuntu but I just can’t make myself like Gnome Shell.
