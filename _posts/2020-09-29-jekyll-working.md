I have recreated my Jekyll blog and have created a script called jekyll.sh which I'm hoping allows me to automatically upload to my rpi4 server.

Steps are:
  * Create or update something in posts subdirectory
  * run the bundle update jekyll serve command to update the sites subdirectory
  * run /home/terry/bin/jekyll.sh to upload
