**First New Blog Post**

So I decided that I’m terrible at web design and that css is way too fiddly for me to want to use it to design a web site. So I’m going to try a website that just made up of tools. Right now this is wordpress – where I’m writing this – and mediawiki where I’ve been doing some note taking. Of course I also have local notes in Zim, Cherrytree, Google Keep, and probably other places.
