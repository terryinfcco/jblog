So I spent a bunch of yesterday installing Virtualbox under Manjaro Linux and then installing Windows 10 under Virtualbox. Then I installed Photoshop Elements 2019. So now I can work on the Udemy Photoshop Elements course without rebooting. I think I should bring Quicken over also. So thatâ€™s probably one of the next activities.
