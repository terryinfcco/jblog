I spent the morning doing the taxes so no technology work got done. Yesterday I did start writing out pseudo code which exactly matches the python solver at this time. I can already see the main loop needs to be rewritten so that I check for untried solutions that will end up too long no matter what. I’m also thinking of using the hostinger account for a test bed for the Udemy classes and whatever other studying I’m thinking of doing and restricting this journal and other notes to this raspberry pi server.

I do confess that I’m uncomfortable with having this system on a raspberry pi where there’s no easy way to keep the files on dropbox.
