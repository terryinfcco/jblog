So I now have a blog with Wordpress and one with Jekyll. I'm thinking maybe I should have a private (i.e. on purplepi2) blog using wordpress that's easy to keep up, and a public blog using something like jekyll where I'll only put things that have some general usefulness. For example the instructions on how to install dokuwiki on a raspberry pi running raspbian buster.
