So after watching a bunch of videos and reading some, I have a website where blog posts show up on the front page and I have navigation pages that narrow down the categories so I can click to get all pages and posts that have the category of 'jekyll' for example.

Putting the pages into subfolders worked great, as did creating a categories page that is linked to on the front page and contains links to all the category pages. I'm really pleased with what I have.

To add a new category the categories page has to be edited and a page for the category has to be created following the pattern of the flask_all and jekyll_all pages. I'm sure it's possible that I can clean the code up a bit and maybe use includes or something.
