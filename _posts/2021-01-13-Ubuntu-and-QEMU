## Jekyll Thoughts

Why not just mostly use the jekyll blog online. I can edit from anywhere, the add commit process is easier, but the editor isn't as good. Thinking about it though.

## Ubuntu Thoughts

After listening to the Ubuntu podcase about Rolling Rhino and then the feedback two weeks later. Why not just install the latest Ubuntu LTS and then if I want more 
up to date software or a different desktop environment to work in, install those in QEMU/KVM or some other kind of container? Worth thinking about.
