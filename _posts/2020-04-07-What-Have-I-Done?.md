So haven’t written in 3 weeks and I’ve done my usual amount of changing everything in the last 3 weeks. But here’s the status of the technology right now.

I’m back to using the beelink as my linux computer. Currently the default boot is Manjaro running Openbox. Kubuntu 20.04 and Manjaro KDE are also installed. I’ve installed boinc on the Raspberry Pi 4 and am trying to run Rosetta which is supposedly the tool that’s working on Covid 19 projects. But as of this afternoon boinc can’t communicate with the Rosetta project. But yoyo@home is perfectly happy running.

The Alienware X51 R3 is running windows and is used for Steam and GOG gaming, quicken, and I just finished using it for doing the 2019 taxes.

And I’ve decided to stop frogging around looking for the perfect way to take notes and I’m using my Hostinger account for this WordPress blog and for dokuwiki for whatever documentation I want to do.
