# Install Flask 

* Change to Directory where you want to create the project
* Create a Virtual Environment
* Use pip freeze to show everything installed in our venv
* Install flask: ```pip install flask```
* pip freeze should now show several things that were installed including flask.

``` bash
cd /home/terry/Sync/flasker
python -m venv flasker_virt
source flasker_virt/bin/activate
pip freeze
pip install flask
pip freeze

```
